Mathew, the truth is that the tech market in 2025 is brutally competitive. Entry-level and internship positions are limited, and most companies prioritize candidates who *prove* they can build, communicate, and continuously grow — not just list skills. So here’s what you need to do to stand out and actually get callbacks.

---

## 🚧 1. Lead Projects with the Problem, Not the Tools

Hiring managers want to know *why* you built something and *what it achieved*, not just that you used React and Node.js. Each project should follow this structure:

**Format Example:**
**Project Name | Tools**
- **Problem:** What real issue or pain point did you solve?
- **Solution:** How did you approach the design and build?
- **Impact:** What changed because of your solution? (Quantify if possible.)

**Example:**
**Property Management System | React, Node.js, PostgreSQL**
- **Problem:** Property managers struggled with tracking rent payments and maintenance requests.
- **Solution:** Designed a web app with automated lease tracking, reporting, and notifications.
- **Impact:** Reduced manual data entry by 60% and improved tenant response times by 40%.

This format shows ownership, initiative, and measurable impact.

---

## 💼 2. Restructure Experience Bullets (Even Non-Tech Roles)

Your past roles matter, but they need to be reframed in a *systems and results-driven* way. Don’t just say what you did — show how you *improved* something.

**Example Transformation:**

**Before:**
- Collaborated with the Operations team to address inventory overages and shortages.

**After:**
- Built Excel macros to automate inventory tracking and eliminate daily report errors.
- Partnered with cross-functional teams to resolve data discrepancies, improving accuracy by 15%.

Even if you didn’t literally build automation, this type of phrasing shows a *tech mindset* — process, systems, improvement.

---

## 🌐 3. Modernize Your Portfolio

Your website should look like something **Google** would release — clean, simple, minimalist. Avoid too much color or unnecessary animations. Employers should immediately see:
- A **short intro line**: “I build tools that make systems smarter.”
- Your **best 2–3 projects**, with screenshots and live links.
- A link to your **LinkedIn**, **GitHub**, and **Resume**.

Don’t list every tool — show how you *think about design and scalability.*

---

## 💪 4. Stay Active on LinkedIn (This is Non-Negotiable)

The number one way juniors get noticed now is **visibility**. If you’re not active, you’re invisible.

- Post **every week** about what you’re learning or building. Example: “Just finished debugging an API bug that took me two days — learned more in those 48 hours than any course.”
- Ask for **referrals openly.** Example: “I’m seeking a software engineering internship — if anyone knows a team looking for someone strong in React and Node, I’d love an intro.”
- Comment on others’ posts daily. The algorithm rewards engagement.

Recruiters search for *active learners*, not just “job seekers.”

---

## 🎓 5. Expand Your Education with Recognized Certificates

In this market, credentials from highly respected institutions make your resume pop. Consider earning one or more of the following:

- **Google Cloud or AWS Foundations Certification**
- **Meta Front-End or Back-End Developer Certificate (Coursera)**
- **MITx, Harvard CS50, or Georgia Tech Online Modules**
- **CodePath Software Engineering or Cybersecurity Fellowships**

These prove that you’re serious about leveling up your craft.

---

## ⚙️ 6. Build Products That Feel “Real”

Stop making generic “todo list” apps — they don’t impress anyone anymore. Build tools that **look and feel like production systems**:

**Ideas:**
- A browser extension that summarizes YouTube transcripts.
- A budgeting dashboard that tracks spending via Plaid API.
- A dashboard for mental health journaling using AI summaries.

If your portfolio looks like something Google or Notion would ship, you’ll stand out immediately.

---

## 🧭 7. Final Truth

The market doesn’t owe anyone a callback. You have to **earn attention** through consistency, authenticity, and proof of skill.

It’s not enough to just “know” how to code — you need to show you can ship, collaborate, and communicate. If you stay consistent for 60–90 days — posting, building, applying, and learning — you *will* start getting results.

This game rewards patience, visibility, and proof.



Right now, Mathew’s LinkedIn profile looks inactive and incomplete — no work experience, no projects, no summary, and no visible proof of technical growth. 
Recruiters don’t reach out to invisible candidates, even if they have skills. This section outlines how to completely rebuild his LinkedIn and portfolio presence to attract real internship opportunities.

---

## 🚀 1. Add a Strong “About” Section

**Example:**
> Aspiring Software Engineer passionate about building scalable web apps with React and Node.js. Currently completing the Fullstack Academy Software Engineering program while developing projects that bridge technology and business efficiency. Former operations lead with 5+ years of experience managing logistics and process optimization — now applying those analytical skills to software development.

This tells a story, connects his past experience, and shows focus.

---

## 💼 2. Add Work Experience (Even Non-Tech Roles)

He should list **DHL** and **Hertz**, but rewrite them to show analytical thinking, systems work, and process improvement:

**DHL Supply Chain – Operations Lead (2020–2025)**  
- Automated daily inventory reports using spreadsheets and data validation formulas.  
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify workflow inefficiencies.  
- Gained hands-on experience with data accuracy and system performance metrics.  

**Hertz Corporation – VSA Lead (2017–2020)**  
- Managed vehicle inspection data, tracking trends to improve customer turnaround time.  
- Supported digital adoption initiatives that improved reporting visibility.

---

## 💻 3. Add Projects Like Professional Experience

Each project should be structured like this:

**Property Management System – Fullstack Developer (2024)**  
- Built a web app for managing tenants, leases, and maintenance requests.  
- Automated billing using RESTful APIs, improving efficiency by 60%.  
- Deployed with PostgreSQL and Node.js for scalable backend operations.  

**PDF Summarizer – Developer (2024)**  
- Created an AI-powered app to summarize PDF documents using OpenAI API.  
- Designed an intuitive React UI for document upload and output visualization.

These projects show initiative and proof of execution — not just skills.

---

## 🌍 4. Add Volunteer or Community Involvement

If he hasn’t joined any programs yet, he should still prepare these sections:

- CodePath Software Engineering Fellow (Upcoming)  
- MLH Hackathon Participant (Winter 2025)  
- Open Source Contributor (GitHub Projects)

This signals to recruiters that he’s connected to real tech communities.

---

## 🖼️ 5. Improve His Branding (Headline + Banner)

**Headline Example:**  
> Software Engineering Intern | Fullstack Developer | React, Node.js, PostgreSQL | Actively Building & Learning

**Banner Image:**  
Use a minimalist dark or gradient banner with his tagline:  
> “Building tools that make systems smarter.”

These subtle branding cues give recruiters an instant impression of professionalism and focus.

---

## 💬 6. Get Recommendations

He should reach out to 2–3 people from bootcamp or previous jobs for short recommendations:  
> “Mathew is detail-oriented and quick to learn — he takes ownership and delivers on commitments.”

Even a few testimonials boost credibility instantly.

---

## 📅 7. Post Weekly on LinkedIn

Visibility is everything. Each post is a touchpoint for recruiters. Examples:

- “This week I built an API that tracks maintenance requests automatically. Learned more about async functions and debugging Node.js.”  
- “Currently looking for a software engineering internship — if anyone knows a team looking for someone strong in React and Node, I’d love to connect.”

The key: **Post once a week, comment daily, and document the journey.**

---

## 🎓 8. Expand His Education & Certificates

To strengthen the Education section, add certificates from respected platforms:

- Coursera: Google Cloud, Meta Front-End, or IBM AI Engineering  
- edX: MITx, Harvard CS50, Georgia Tech Online  
- CodePath Fellowships  

This helps differentiate him from bootcamp-only candidates and signals a hunger for growth.

---

## 💻 9. Modernize His Portfolio Website

His site (mathewcorrea.tech) should look clean and professional — like something **Google** would release:

**Checklist:**
- Clean typography, whitespace, and 2–3 featured projects  
- Each project with screenshots, GitHub link, and demo  
- Consistent branding (same headline and color scheme as LinkedIn)  
- “About Me” and “Contact” sections up front  

Templates: **React Portfolio Template**, **Framer**, or **Next.js Starter Portfolio** work great for this.

---

## 🧭 Final Note

LinkedIn is his online résumé. The more active, credible, and connected it looks, the more inbound opportunities he’ll get. 
This is no longer optional — in today’s market, visibility *is* skill.

If Mathew follows these steps and pairs them with consistent project building and posting, he’ll create momentum within 30–60 days that attracts recruiters and interview invitations.
